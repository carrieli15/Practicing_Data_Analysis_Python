                "<span style=\"color: #008080\">1. Increased College Attainment Over Time: Both men and women under 40 have a lower percentage of individuals with college degrees than those 40 and over. This suggests that college attainment has increased over time for both genders.\n",
                "\n",
                "<span style=\"color: #008080\">2. Gender Gap in College Attainment is Decreasing: Among those 40 and over, a slightly higher percentage of women have college degrees than men. In contrast, for those under 40, the percentage of women with degrees is closer to the percentage of men with degrees. This suggests that the gender gap in college attainment has decreased over time.\n",
                "\n",
                "<span style=\"color: #008080\">3. Higher Proportion of Young People Without Degrees: The percentage of young people (under 40) without degrees is higher than that of older people (40 and over) for both genders. However, this doesn't necessarily mean younger generations are less educated. It could be because many in the under-40 group are still in the process of completing their education.\n",

                "<span style=\"color: #008080\">In summary, while college attainment has generally increased over time for both men and women, the gender gap in college attainment appears to be narrowing, with women slightly outpacing men in recent generations.\n",
